\begin{abstract}
	After being exempted from in-clinic physical therapy, 
	it is usual for a patient to continue performing exercises 
	outside of the clinic and without any therapist's supervision.
	While performing unsupervised exercises, it would be desirable 
	to receive similar feedback as the one provided by a physical therapist, to maintain 
	a certain quality in the task execution.
	To address this problem, several approaches using feedback for rehabilitation have been implemented. Unfortunately, the test subjects frequently reported difficulty in completely understanding the feedback given to them, therefore failing to correctly execute the given movement.
